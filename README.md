This project is a **data analysis** of Amazon's annual 50 best-selling books from **2009 to 2019**. The primary goal was to uncover hidden trends and statistical relationships within the dataset to determine common characteristics of books that achieve best-seller status.

### Key Questions Explored:

- How do ratings and reviews counts correlate across different genres?
- What are the yearly trends in the proportion of Fiction vs Non-Fiction best-sellers?
- Which authors and books have the highest number of repeat appearances?

## üìä Key Findings & Visualizations
